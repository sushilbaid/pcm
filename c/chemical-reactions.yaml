- reactants and products along with their physical state represent a chemical reaction.
- atoms are balanced on both side.
- two+ substances combine to form one substance in a combination reaction 
- one substance decompose into multiple substances in a decomposition reaction
- heat is released in exothermic reaction. is absorted in endothermic reaction.
- an element displaces another element from its compoound in displacement reaction.
- two ions are exchanged in a double displacement reaction.
- precipitation reaction produce insoluble salt.
- oxidation is gain of oxygen of loss of hydrogen. reduction is loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen.
- physical state is g (gas), l(liquid), aq (aqueous), s(solid)
- combination-reactions:
  - CaO + H20 = Ca(OH)2 (aq) # Cacium Oxide (slated lime) with water gives calcium hydroxide.
  - Ca(OH)2 + C02 (g) = CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l) # calcium carbonate is formed after 3-4 days of whitewash and gives shine
  - C(s) + O2(g) = CO2
- decomposition-reaction:
  - CaCO3 heat-> CaO(s) (quick lime) + CO2
  - 2Pb(NO3)2(s) heat-> 2PbO(s) + 4(NO2)(g) + O2(g) #lead nitrade on heating gives lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen
- displacement-reactions:
  - zinc and lead are more reactive than copper. they displace it when reacting wih ZnSO4 (aq) and PbCl2 (aq)
  - Zn(s) + CuSO4 (aq) -> ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu(s)
  - Pb(s) + CuCl2 (aq) -> PbCl2 (aq) + Cu(s)
- double-displacement-reactions:
  - Na2SO4 (aq) + BaCl2 (aq) -> BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)
  - Pb(NO3)2 + 2KI (aq) -> PbI2 (s) + 2KNO3 (aq)
- oxidation-reduction-reason:
  - 2CuO + H2 = Cu + H2O
  - ZnO + C -> Zn + CO (g)
  - chip manufacturer packs N2 gas along with chips to avoid oxidation
- equations:
  - 3H2 (g) + N2 (g) = 2NH3 (g)
  - 2H2S (g) + 3O2 = 2SO2 + 2H20
