- reactants and products along with their physical state represent a chemical reaction.
- atoms are balanced on both side.
- two+ substances combine to form one substance in a combination reaction 
- one substance decompose into multiple substances in a decomposition reaction
- heat is released in exothermic reaction. is absorted in endothermic reaction. 
- respiration is exothermic.
- an element displaces another element from its compoound in displacement reaction.
- two ions are exchanged in a double displacement reaction.
- precipitation reaction produce insoluble salt.
- oxidation is gain of oxygen of loss of hydrogen. reduction is loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen.
- physical state is g (gas), l(liquid), aq (aqueous), s(solid)
- The arrangement of metals as per reactivity series is K > Na > Ba > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Ni > Sn > Pb > H > Cu > Ag > Au.
- combination-reactions:
  - CaO + H20 = Ca(OH)2 (aq) # Cacium Oxide (quick lime) with water gives (slated lime calcium hydroxide) along with lot of heat
  - Ca(OH)2 + C02 (g) = CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l) # calcium carbonate is formed after 3-4 days of whitewash and gives shine
  - CaCO3(s) (limestone on heat) = CaO(s) (quick lime) + CO2(l) # 
  - C(s) + O2(g) = CO2 # burning of coal
  - 2H2(g) + O2(g) = 2H20(l) #formation of water
- decomposition-reaction:
  - CaCO3 heat-> CaO(s) (quick lime) + CO2
  - 2FeSO4 (on heat) = Fe2O3(s) + SO3(g) + SO4(g)
  - 2Pb(NO3)2(s) on heat-> 2PbO(s) + 4(NO2)(g) + O2(g) #lead nitrade on heating gives lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen
- displacement-reactions:
  - zinc and lead are more reactive than copper. they displace it when reacting wih ZnSO4 (aq) and PbCl2 (aq)
  - Zn(s) + CuSO4 (aq) -> ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu(s)
  - Pb(s) + CuCl2 (aq) -> PbCl2 (aq) + Cu(s)
- double-displacement-reactions:
  - Na2SO4 (aq) + BaCl2 (aq) -> BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)
  - Pb(NO3)2 + 2KI (aq) -> PbI2 (s) + 2KNO3 (aq)
- oxidation-reduction-reaction:
  - CuO + H2 = Cu + H2O
  - ZnO + C -> Zn + CO (g)
  - chip manufacturer packs N2 gas along with chips to avoid oxidation
- equations:
  - 3H2 (g) + N2 (g) = 2NH3 (g)
  - 2H2S (g) + 3O2 = 2SO2 + 2H20 # hydrogen sulphide gas burns in air gives sulpher dioxide and water
  - Mg + O2 = 2MgO # ribbon burnt generates Magnesium oxide
  - Cu(s) + O2 = 2CuO(s) # black CuO formed on heating shiny copper in air
  - 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) = Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
  - 6CO2(aq) + 12H2O(l) -> sunlight/chlorophyll = C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2 + 6H2O(l) # glucose generated by using catalyst.
  - C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g) = 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy # respiration
  - 2AgCl(s) (on sunlight)= 2Ag(s) + Cl2
  - SAgBr(s) (on sunlight)= 2Ag(s) + Br2(g) #black and white protograhy
  - Fe(s) + 2HCL = FeCL2(s) +  H2(g)
  - 3H2(g) + N2(g) = 2NH3(g) # amonia
  - 3BaCl2(s) + Al2(SO4)3 = 3BaSO4 + 2AlCl3
  - 2K(s) + 2H2O(l) = 2KOH(aq) + H2(g)
  - C2H5OH(ethanol aka grain alcohol) + 3O2(g) â†’ 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g) #combustion reaction between hydrocarbon and oxygen
  - CH4 + 2O2(g) = CO2 + 2H20 + heat # combustion reaction
- balance equations:
  - 2HNO3(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) = Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2H2O(l)
  - 2NaOH + H2SO4(aq) = Na2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)
